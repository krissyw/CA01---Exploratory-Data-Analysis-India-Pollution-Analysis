Peer Evaluation for CA01 - Exploratory Data Analysis: India Pollution Analysis

# India Pollution Data 
This repository contains Python code for using exploratory data analysis to analyze Indian Air Quality dataset, downloaded from Loyola Marymount University's Brightspace. 

# Dataset: Basic Info

What is it about?
This data is released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution 
Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy 
(NDSAP), using this one can explore India’s air pollution levels at a more granular scale. 

What information it has?
The dataset has 13 columns which are, 
  stn_code: Station Code 
  sampling_date: Date of sampling (note how this is formatted) 
  state: State 
  location: Location of recording 
  agency: Agency 
  type: Type of area 
  so2: Sulphur dioxide (μg/m3) 
  no2: Nitrogen dioxide (μg/m3) 
  rspm: Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (μg/m3) 
  spm: Suspended Particulate Matter (μg/m3) 
  location_monitoring_station: Location of data collection 
  pm2_5: PSI 2.5 (μg/m3) 
  date: Date of sampling 

Why we need these details?
SPM, RSPM, PM2.5 values are the parameters used to measure the quality of air based 
on the number of particles present in it. Using these values, we are going to identify the 
air quality over the period of time in different states of India
